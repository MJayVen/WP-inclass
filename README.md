Hi! My name's **Mark** and I'm currently a senior computer science major at SUNY New Paltz.

Most of the major projects I've worked on in my college experience so far have been web-based. For example, for my software engineering class, I was on a team making an EHR where I built (among other things) a patient search page, a calendar scheduling system, and a page that generates a couple simple graphs based on data from our site's database. I learned a ton about *HTML*, *CSS*, *PHP*, and simply working with a team. 

Also, during this past summer I took an web programming course taught by **Kaitlin Hoffman**. The main project for that class was to build a simple social media website. The focus of the class was on *JavaScript* and many of it's popular libraries and frameworks, including *Node*, *Express*, *Mongoose*, and *React*. I knew essentially nothing about javascript before this, but it was probably the most exciting programming class I've taken so far! Since this was a summer course, I would spend almost every day working on my site from the time I woke up until the late afternoon, trying to give my site it's own personal style, making it an actually functional website, and learning as much as I could. I had never seriously considered being a web programmer professionally until I took that class. When Professor Hoffman recommended this course for a more in-depth look into web development, I signed up as soon as I could.

Which leads me to why I'm taking this class. At the moment, my ideal career choice would be to become a web dev with a focus on backend functionality, though I do have fun working on the front end as well. I'm hoping this class will be able to prepare me somewhat for that. Plus, websites are something I'd simply like to know more about. I've used them on a daily basis basically my entire life, it only makes sense I have at least a general understanding for how they work.
